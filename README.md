# Model Texture Transition And Procedural Radial Noise Using WebGL

This WebGL experiment explores two visual effects: a texture transition on a 3D can model and a procedural radial noise field. The model's texture transitions vertically with a noise effect at the seam. In the background, a ring of pulsing noise emanates from the center, extending beyond the screen's edges.
